# Computer Vision - COVID19 Image Classification. - By David Salako.

## Background, Goal, and Context.

Provided are a training set and a test set of images of 3 classes. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 3 classes:

    COVID-19,
    Viral Pneumonia, and
    Normal.

The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining the class of the X-ray image.

## The context is:

    To differentiate an X-ray image of a normal person from that of an unhealthy one.
    The ability to do so effectively can mean better diagnosis.


## Dataset:

The project is inspired from a dataset from Kaggle. Note: For project purposes, the dataset is modified according to the learning requirements. You are provided with the following files:

    testimage.npy
    testLabels.csv
    trainimage.npy
    trainLabels.csv

The dataset (above 4 files) was downloaded from the Olympus platform of Great Learning.

## Objective.

To implement the techniques learned as a part of the course with the following learning outcomes:

    Pre-processing of image data.
    Visualization of images.
    Building CNN.
    Evaluate the Model.
